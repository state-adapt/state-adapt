## StateAdapt's Purpose

Features should naturally evolve in a declarative manner to support unpredictable business requirements.
Simple features should not need heavy syntax to be declarative,
and adding complexity should not require drastic refactors.

Declarative code is when declarations are complete. Rather than requiring scattered imperarive code, declarative code is reactive.

Declarative code has many benefits:

1. [Focus](https://dev.to/mfp22/rxjs-can-save-your-codebase-49fi#focus)
2. [Debugging with Context](https://dev.to/mfp22/rxjs-can-save-your-codebase-49fi#debugging-with-context)
3. [Avoiding Bugs with Context](https://dev.to/mfp22/rxjs-can-save-your-codebase-49fi#avoiding-bugs-with-context)
4. [Comprehensibility](https://dev.to/mfp22/rxjs-can-save-your-codebase-49fi#comprehensibility)
5. [Separation of Concerns / Colocation](https://dev.to/mfp22/rxjs-can-save-your-codebase-49fi#declarativeness-in-rxjs-vs-signals-only)
6. [Consistent State](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/5-reasons-to-avoid-imperative-code-e09#1-inconsistent-state)
7. [State Locality](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/5-reasons-to-avoid-imperative-code-e09#2-state-elevation)
8. [Smaller Bundles](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/5-reasons-to-avoid-imperative-code-e09#3-large-bundles)
9. [Intuitive Dependency Direction](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/5-reasons-to-avoid-imperative-code-e09#4-unnecessary-complexity)
10. [Easier and Better Variable Names](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/5-reasons-to-avoid-imperative-code-e09#bad-function-names)

The web development industry is inevitably transitioning towards more and more declarative code. But, it is happening very slowly, one layer of complexity at a time.

**StateAdapt's purpose is to accelerate the industry transition to declarative code by providing tools that enable and simplify declarative code for every level of complexity.**
